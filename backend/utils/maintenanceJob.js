/**
 * Maintenance Job Utility
 * 
 * This module automates periodic maintenance tasks for the election system. It performs actions
 * such as auto-rejecting stale nominations, cleaning up expired OTPs, and sending notification
 * emails. The maintenance job is designed to be idempotent and safe to run multiple times.
 * 
 * Exports:
 * - maintenanceJob: An asynchronous function that performs all maintenance tasks.
 * 
 * Notes:
 * - Ensure SMTP settings are configured in the environment for email notifications.
 * - Errors are logged to the console but do not interrupt the execution of other tasks.
